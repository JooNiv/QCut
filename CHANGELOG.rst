**Version 2.2.0**
=================

Breaking changes
----------------

- A :code:`SparsePauliOp` is now **one** observable, the weighted sum of its terms, as
  it is for :code:`EstimatorV2`. It used to be read as a list of observables, one
  expectation value per Pauli, with its coefficients ignored. To keep that reading,
  pass the labels themselves: :code:`SparsePauliOp(["IZ", "ZI"])` becomes
  :code:`["IZ", "ZI"]`.
- The expectation values are shaped like the observables given, as an estimator's are,
  so one observable comes back as a zero-dimensional array and a list of :code:`n` as
  :code:`(n,)`.
- :code:`CutExperiment.observables` is now the :code:`ObservablesArray` that was asked
  for, and has no :code:`len()`, use :code:`.size` or :code:`.shape`. The Pauli terms
  the circuits actually measure are :code:`CutExperiment.observable_terms`.
- :code:`quasi_probabilities()`, :code:`nearest_probabilities()` and :code:`counts()`
  return, by default, the ten most likely bitstrings rather than all of them, most likely first.
  All three take :code:`top` for a different number and :code:`top=None` for the
  previous behaviour. Note that :code:`counts()` sums to :code:`shots` only with :code:`top=None` and
  Only :code:`quasi_probabilities()` gets cheaper this way since the other two project onto the
  nearest physical distribution first.

Reconstructing a distribution no longer costs :code:`2**k`
----------------------------------------------------------

- Reconstructing a distribution over :code:`k` qubits is now flat in :code:`k` rather
  than exponential in it with a proper reconstruction method. See `the 
  derivation <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/theory/Probability_reconstruction.html>`__.
- The distribution is held in that product form, so three new queries never expand it:
  :code:`top(count)` gives the most likely bitstrings, exactly, by branch and bound
  (measured at 17 ms and 0.2 MB for the top 100 of 2\ :sup:`24`, against 270 ms and
  384 MB just to hold the values); :code:`probability_of(bitstring)` gives one value in
  about 25 microseconds whatever :code:`k` is; and :code:`marginal(qubits)` gives a
  coarser distribution over a subset. :code:`probabilities()` returns every value as a
  numpy array.
- The observables of an experiment given :code:`qubits` are built on demand, so nothing
  pays for the :code:`2**k` Pauli labels unless it asks for them, and the weights
  between them and the terms are never written out at all. Estimating them with
  :code:`estimate_expectation_values()` still works.
- Reconstruction is now sparse, costing shots rather than :code:`2**num_qubits` per subcircuit.
- Fixed :code:`top()` skipping unmeasured outcomes

Observables as qiskit's estimator takes them
--------------------------------------------

- :code:`observables` now takes anything qiskit's estimator takes: a Pauli label, a
  :code:`Pauli`, a :code:`SparsePauliOp`, a :code:`SparseObservable`, a
  :code:`{label: coefficient}` mapping, or any nested sequence of those. Coefficients
  are applied rather than ignored.
- Projector terms are supported: :code:`0 1 + - r l`, whether written as labels or
  carried by a :code:`SparseObservable`.

**Version 2.1.4**
=================
- Small fixes to transpilation on IQM Star backends

**Version 2.1.3**
=================

- Reading results is orders of magnitude quicker. Each subcircuit is read once per group
  rather than walking every combination of their outcomes, and observables sharing a
  measurement setting are read together.
- :code:`get_experiment_circuits()` no longer raises :code:`CircuitError: register size
  error` on a transpiled subcircuit whose routing moved a qubit onto a wire a wire cut
  had ended. The qubits left to measure are counted by qubit rather than by the wire
  holding one.
- :code:`run()` and :code:`run_cut_circuit()` take :code:`run_options` as well.
- Added :code:`ParallelBackend`, which runs an experiment on several backends at once,
  each batch transpiled for the one about to run it.
  See `Running on several backends <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/examples/ParallelBackends.html>`__.
- Added :code:`transpile_circuits()`, which takes a :code:`CutCircuit`, a
  :code:`CutExperiment` or plain circuits.
- :code:`transpile_experiments()` defaults to :code:`optimization_level=3` rather than
  :code:`0`, and no longer raises on a backend without a target, such as a simulator.

**Version 2.1.2**
=================

- :code:`transpile_subcircuits()` followed by :code:`get_experiment_circuits()` or
  :code:`run_cut_circuit()` no longer raises :code:`AttributeError` on a non IQM
  :code:`BackendV2`, such as :code:`GenericBackendV2` or one of IBM's.
- Generating experiment circuits is about a third quicker and takes about half the
  memory.
- A generated QPD, joint rotation cuts included, merges the gate's local unitaries into
  its operations instead of carrying them as separate gates, so the circuits hold about
  a third fewer instructions.
- :code:`CutExperiment.group_size` returns the number of circuits in a group, as
  documented, rather than the instruction count of the first subcircuit.

**Version 2.1.1**
=================

- :code:`run()` and :code:`run_cut_circuit()` take :code:`qubits` as well, and return the
  reconstructed distribution instead of expectation values when given it.
  :code:`observables` is optional on both, and passing neither or both raises.

**Version 2.1.0**
=================

Reconstructing a probability distribution
-----------------------------------------

- :code:`get_experiment_circuits()` takes :code:`qubits` in place of
  :code:`observables`, and :code:`estimate_probabilities()` then reconstructs the
  distribution over those qubits by an inverse Walsh-Hadamard transform. Costs
  :code:`2**k` observables but no extra circuits, since they share one measurement
  setting.
  See `the derivation <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/theory/Probability_reconstruction.html>`__.
- The result is a :code:`dict` of quasi-probabilities, which can be negative.
  :code:`nearest_probabilities()` gives the closest true distribution and
  :code:`counts()` scales it by the shots the experiment ran at, or by one of your own.
- A circuit carrying final measurements can be cut. They are removed on a copy, so the
  circuit passed in is left as it was.
- :code:`RawResult.shots` and :code:`CutExperiment.can_reconstruct_probabilities` are
  public, and the types the public functions return are importable from :code:`QCut`.

**Version 2.0.0**
=================

Breaking changes
----------------

- :code:`RawResult` no longer takes a :code:`samples` argument. It is now
  :code:`RawResult(results, shots, experiment=None)` and carries the experiment itself.
- :code:`RawResult.result()` keeps its shape but each subcircuit now holds a
  :code:`CircuitResult` containing what the backend or sampler returned, plus the shot scale and
  the label selection that group takes from it rather than a counts dict. Call
  :code:`.counts()` on one for the counts.
- Modules are grouped into subpackages: :code:`QCut.qpd`, :code:`QCut.cutting`,
  :code:`QCut.execution`, :code:`QCut.errors` and :code:`QCut.utils`. The names exported
  from :code:`QCut` are unchanged; code importing a module directly has to be updated.
- :code:`find_cuts()` is now deterministic and costs several candidate partitions before
  choosing, so it returns different, cheaper plans than 1.3.2 did for the same circuit.
- :code:`find_cuts()` now reads its configuration from a :code:`CutOptions` object rather than from keyword arguments. See
  `Options <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/Options.html>`__ and `Automatic cuts <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/examples/AutomaticCuts.html>`__ for details.
- Cut edge weights are :code:`log gamma` rather than :code:`gamma`, which also changes
  which cuts are chosen. See `Automatic cuts <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/examples/AutomaticCuts.html>`__.
- Subcircuits are no longer given empty classical registers, and an unused
  :code:`qpd_meas` register is dropped. Code reading registers by position rather than by
  name has to be updated.
- :code:`CutExperiment.expv_data()` is gone and :code:`estimate_expectation_values()`
  takes only the results, which now carry the experiment they came from. Replace
  :code:`estimate_expectation_values(results, experiment.expv_data())` with
  :code:`estimate_expectation_values(results)`.
  See `Usage <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/Usage.html>`__.
- :code:`get_experiment_circuits()` no longer modifies the :code:`CutCircuit` it is
  given, so one can be reused for several observable sets.
- :code:`transpile_subcircuits()` raises rather than quietly overriding when
  :code:`remove_final_rzs` or :code:`optimize_single_qubits` is passed for an IQM
  backend. Those rewrite a circuit that still carries cut placeholders; use
  :code:`transpile_experiments()` instead.
- :code:`perform_move_routing` now defaults to whether the backend needs it, on for a
  resonator device and off otherwise, and an explicit value is honoured either way.

Cutting arbitrary two-qubit gates
---------------------------------

- Any two-qubit gate can be cut, with the decomposition derived from its KAK
  coordinates. See `Gate cuts <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/examples/GateCuts.html>`__ and
  `Theory <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/Theory.html>`__.

Joint cutting of parallel rotation gates
----------------------------------------

- Single-axis rotation gates running in parallel between the same two partitions share
  one decomposition: two parallel :code:`rzz` cost 30 subexperiments instead of 36, three
  cost 132 instead of 216. On by default.
  See `the derivation <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/theory/Joint_rotation_derivation.html>`__.

Wire cuts with classical communication
--------------------------------------

- A block of parallel wire cuts can exchange the measured outcome, taking the overhead
  from :code:`4**n` to :code:`2**(n+1) - 1` and two wires from 64 subexperiments to 28.
  These run in waves. Used by default for blocks of two or more.
  See `the derivation <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/theory/LOCC_wire_derivation.html>`__.

Gate consolidation
------------------

- Runs of gates on the same qubit pair are merged before cutting, so the pair costs one
  cut. Runs need not be contiguous, gates that commute with the run are moved out of the
  way. On by default, and compared against not merging.
  See `Options <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/Options.html>`__.

Sampling instead of enumerating
-------------------------------

- The experiment can be sampled from the quasiprobability distribution rather than
  enumerated, which bounds the number of circuits when the exact count is out of reach.
  Automatic above 1000 groups. See `Options <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/Options.html>`__.

Configuration
-------------

- Added :code:`CutOptions`, collected once and carried through the run. Covers
  consolidation, joint cuts, wire cut communication, expansion strategy, sampling and the
  cut finder. See `Options <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/Options.html>`__.

Knowing what a cut costs
------------------------

- :code:`CutCircuit.gamma` is the sampling overhead of a split and
  :code:`CutCircuit.optimal_gamma` the least those same cuts could cost with every
  decomposition available. Both are closed form, so the cost of a plan can be read
  before any experiment circuits are built. :code:`CutExperiment` carries both forward.

Running on real hardware
------------------------

- Improved and fixed bugs in transpilation for real backends.
- Better IQM support: :code:`pip install "QCut[iqm]"`, and both transpile helpers use IQM's own
  transpiler for IQM backends, resonator machines included. Pass
  :code:`use_iqm_transpiler=False` to opt out.
  See `Usage <https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/Usage.html>`__.
- Resonator devices are supported by both transpile helpers. Their MOVE gates are routed
  while the subcircuits still carry cut placeholders, which the routing pass used to
  drop along with the classical registers and the layout.
  :code:`use_iqm_transpiler=False` raises for them, since standard qiskit has no MOVE gate.
- :code:`transpile_experiments()` works on IQM backends.
- A block of parallel wire cuts is never bundled for a resonator device, which reports
  its qubits as fully coupled but has no two-qubit gate that avoids its resonator. Those
  cuts fall back to one block per wire rather than to the local decomposition.
- :code:`run_experiments()` also takes a V2 sampler as its :code:`backend`, on both the
  plain and the communicating execution path. Note that
  :code:`qiskit.primitives.StatevectorSampler` cannot be used, since it refuses
  mid-circuit measurements.
- Every batch of a wave is submitted before any of it is collected, so a run queues all
  of its jobs at once rather than waiting out each batch in turn.
- :code:`run_experiments()` takes :code:`run_options`, passed on to every :code:`run`
  call. A target that batches on its own account, such as
  `fiqci-ems <https://github.com/FiQCI/fiqci-ems>`__ does, is also given QCut's
  :code:`max_batch_size`, so it does not split a batch QCut has already sized.
- :code:`run()` and :code:`run_cut_circuit()` now take :code:`shots`.

Other
-----

- :code:`from QCut import *` no longer raises.
- Test suite split into tiers. See :code:`CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Dropped pickle, experiment generation is much faster.
- :code:`finder_max_qubits` no longer raises when given as a list.
- Benchmarks against IBM's cutting addon, in :code:`benchmarks/`.

**Version 1.3.2**
=================
- Fix bug in how weights for different gates were being handled by `QCutFind`.

**Version 1.3.1**
=================
- Fix bug in `find_cuts()` where on circuits that already had the desired partition early return condition would return incorrect type.

**Version 1.3.0**
=================

Support for cutting SWAP and iSWAP gates
----------------------------------------

- Added support for cutting SWAP and iSWAP gates in addition to CZ gates and wire cuts.
    * Uses optimal QPDs instead of naively decomposing into CZ gates, resulting in significantly fewer subcircuits needed for the same number of cuts.
    * QCutFind also supports finding optimal cut locations for cutting SWAP and iSWAP gates.
    * Refactored codebase to support cutting arbitrary gates in a more modular way, making it easier to add support for cutting more gates in the future.
    * Check documentation for details on how to use.

**Version 1.2.0**
=================

Refactor `run_experiments()`
----------------------------

- Refactor `run_experiments()` to improve performance, flexibility, and code quality.
- `run_experiments()` now batches circuits into groups for more efficient execution on real hardware.
    * By default, circuits are grouped into batches of 100, but this can be adjusted with the `max_batch_size` parameter in `run_experiments()`.
- `run_experiments()` now returns a `RawResults` object instead of a list of preprocessed results. This is to allow for more flexible postprocessing of results, including support for custom postprocessing functions.
    * post processing now automatically happens when calling `get_expectation_values()` that now takes a `RawResults` object as an argument.

Add `RawResults` class
-----------------------

- The `RawResults` object contains the raw results from the backend, as well as metadata such as the number of shots and samples used.
    * This allows for more flexible postprocessing of results, including support for custom postprocessing functions.
    * Like a qiskit result object the `RawResults` has a `result()` method that returns the raw results from the backend. The format is currently quite messy and could be improved in future releases. 


Add logging
------------

- Added logging to the codebase to improve debuggability and provide more information about the execution of the code.
- Examples on how to use the logging can be found in the documentation.
