"""End-to-end checks against a backend with a coupling map.

Nothing else in the suite runs a cut experiment against a backend that has a real
topology, and that gap hid a run of defects: transpilation lays subcircuits out on
physical qubits and pads them to the device width, so reading measurement bits by
position attributed results to the wrong qubits; placeholders were looked up by the
index they had before transpiling; routing borrowed wires that were then measured; a
resonator machine's gate list broke the basis translation; and unused classical
registers made real hardware refuse the job outright. Every one of those passed
``pytest`` while returning wrong numbers or none at all, because the only backend
test asserted gate names.

So these assert values, and that the circuits would be accepted.
