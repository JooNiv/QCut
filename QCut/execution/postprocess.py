    Each outcome is weighted by how often it came up, so the weight carried through to
    the estimator is that outcome's probability.

    The qpd measurement bits are picked out by how many there are rather than by looking
    for their register in the reported counts. A backend is free to rename or merge
    classical registers -- IQM's transpiler does, when it routes through a resonator --
    and a key split on whitespace quietly returns the wrong field when it does. The
    widths come from the experiment, which knows them because it built the circuits.

    Bits that were dropped for going unwritten are put back as -1, which is what an
    unwritten bit reads as, so the sign is the one the full register would have given.
