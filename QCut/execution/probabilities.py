    bitstring at once does, and :meth:`QuasiProbabilities.top`,
    :meth:`QuasiProbabilities.probability_of` and
    :meth:`QuasiProbabilities.marginal` answer without doing that.

    The bitstrings are written with the first of the chosen qubits last, so a subset
    given as ``[2, 0]`` reads qubit 2 as the rightmost character.

    Args:
        result (RawResult): results of an experiment built with ``qubits``.

    Returns:
        QuasiProbabilities: the distribution, which also offers the projected
        distribution and a scaling to counts.

    Raises:
        ValueError: the experiment was built with observables rather than ``qubits``, so
            it does not carry the full set this needs.
