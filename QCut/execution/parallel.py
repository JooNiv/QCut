    """Spread an experiment's jobs over several backends, one batch each in turn.

    QCut submits every batch of a wave before collecting any of it, so handing
    successive batches to different backends leaves them all queued at once. Each batch
    is transpiled for the backend about to run it, so the backends do not have to be
    alike, and only one batch is ever held in its transpiled form. The experiment itself
    stays as it was built.

    Pass it where a backend goes::

        backend = ParallelBackend([first, second])
        results = ck.run_experiments(experiment, shots=4096, backend=backend)

    A batch goes only to a backend wide enough for it, so a fleet of different sizes
    works. The pieces that fit anywhere are shared, and the widest go to the backends
    that can hold them. The batches are dealt out in turn among those that fit.

    The experiment does not have to be transpiled beforehand. Each batch is transpiled
    for the backend.

    Attributes:
        backends (list): the backends, in the order the batches are dealt out.
        submitted (list[int]): how many circuits each has been given, which is what to
            read to see how the work was shared.
