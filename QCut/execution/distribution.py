class Mode:
    r"""One subcircuit's weights, as the outcomes that carry one.

    A mode is indexed by the local outcomes of the bits its subcircuit holds, so it
    spans ``2**width`` rows in principle. Only outcomes that were actually measured
    carry a weight, and a group cannot produce more distinct outcomes than it had
    shots, so the number of rows that matter is bounded by the shot count rather than
    by ``2**width``. Holding them by index is what keeps a wide subcircuit affordable:
    the rows a search reads, and the arithmetic it does per row, then grow with the
    shots rather than with the width.

    Args:
        idx (np.ndarray): the local outcomes carrying a weight, ascending and distinct.
        val (np.ndarray): ``(len(idx), groups)``, their weights per group.
        width (int): how many bits the local outcome spans.
