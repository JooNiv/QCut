"""User-facing configuration for the cutting workflow.

Options are collected once and carried on :class:`QCut.cutcircuit.CutCircuit`, which
passes them to :class:`QCut.cutcircuit.CutExperiment`. Everything downstream reads them
from there, so adding a knob does not mean widening five signatures.

They have to be fixed before the subcircuits are built, because they decide how the
quasiprobability decomposition is formed and therefore what the coefficients mean. A
:class:`CutOptions` is frozen for that reason.

    """Configuration for a cutting run.

    ``consolidate`` merges runs of gates acting on the same qubit pair into one gate
    before cutting, so the pair costs one cut instead of several. See
    :data:`ConsolidateStrategy`. Merging can cost more than it saves once joint cutting
    is in play, because a merged run of gates about different axes is no longer a
    single-axis rotation and cannot be bundled, so ``"auto"`` compares the two plans
    outright rather than guessing.

    ``joint_rotation_cuts`` cuts parallel two-qubit rotation gates with one joint
    decomposition instead of one each, which costs strictly less in both sampling
    overhead and circuit count.

    ``wire_cut_communication`` lets the two sides of a wire cut exchange the measured
    outcome, which lowers the overhead of a block of ``n`` parallel wires from ``4**n``
    to ``2**(n+1) - 1``. It makes those experiments run in two phases, since the state
    one side prepares depends on what the other measured. See
    :data:`CommunicationStrategy`.

    ``expansion`` decides how the decomposition becomes experiment circuits, see
    :data:`ExpansionStrategy`. Under ``"auto"``, ``max_exact_groups`` is the largest
    exact group count still enumerated rather than sampled. When sampling,

    ``finder_candidates`` is how many candidate partitions the cut finder generates and
    costs before keeping the cheapest. METIS returns only the partitioning that
    minimises its own objective, the weighted edge cut, which stops being the true cost
    once cuts share a decomposition, so the candidates are generated one per seed and
    compared on what they actually cost. The seeds are fixed, which makes the finder
    reproducible; ``seed`` shifts them as a set.

    ``num_samples`` draws are taken, defaulting to ``max_exact_groups``, and ``seed``
    fixes the sampler for a reproducible experiment set.
