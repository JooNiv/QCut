        ``gamma`` and ``optimal_gamma`` come from the :class:`CutCircuit` these circuits
        were built from, which is the only thing that can work them out: they are read
        off the subcircuits, and an experiment does not keep those.

        ``num_draws`` records how many samples were drawn when the decomposition was
        sampled rather than enumerated. It is informational. The estimator does not need
        it, because the sampled coefficients already carry their multiplicity.

        ``plan`` is a :class:`QCut.qpd_locc.CommunicationPlan` when any wire cut
        exchanges its measured outcome, and None otherwise. Those experiments run in two
        phases, so execution needs to know which bits carry the outcome.

        ``qpd_bits`` says, per circuit, how many qpd measurement bits it writes and how
        many were dropped for going unwritten. Post-processing needs both: the first to
        find those bits without relying on how a backend reports its registers, and the
        second to restore the sign the dropped ones carried.
