"""Wire cut decomposition that uses classical communication between the partitions.

Cutting a wire without classical communication costs :math:`\\gamma = 4`, and cutting
``n`` of them costs :math:`4^n`. That is already optimal for local operations alone, so
cutting wires as a block buys nothing by itself. Letting the partitions exchange
classical information changes the picture completely, to

.. math::

    \\gamma = 2^{n+1} - 1

so one wire costs 3 rather than 4, two cost 7 rather than 16, and three cost 15 rather
than 64. The number of channels drops from :math:`8^n` to :math:`2^n + 1`.

The construction is Theorem 3 of H. Harada, K. Wada and N. Yamamoto, "Doubly optimal
parallel wire cutting without ancilla qubits", PRX Quantum 5, 040308 (2024),
`arXiv:2303.07340 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07340>`_,

.. math::

    \\mathrm{Id}^{\\otimes n} = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j}
        \\mathrm{Tr}[U_i |j\\rangle\\langle j| U_i^\\dagger (\\cdot)]\\,
        U_i |j\\rangle\\langle j| U_i^\\dagger
      - (2^n - 1) \\sum_j \\mathrm{Tr}[|j\\rangle\\langle j| (\\cdot)]\\, \\rho_j

where the :math:`2^n` unitaries :math:`U_i` rotate the computational basis into the
other mutually unbiased bases and :math:`\\rho_j` is the uniform mixture over the
computational basis states other than :math:`|j\\rangle`. In words, measure in one of
the :math:`2^n + 1` mutually unbiased bases and prepare the state you just measured,
except in the computational basis where you prepare any of the others and flip the sign.

It needs no ancilla qubits, unlike the teleportation-based protocol of Brenner et al.,
but it does need the prepared state to depend on the measured outcome. That is the
classical communication, and it is why these cuts are executed in two phases. See
``docs/theory/LOCC_wire_derivation.md``.

    Pauli strings modulo phase are vectors :math:`(a|b)` over :math:`\mathbb{F}_2^{2n}`,
    two of them commute when the symplectic form :math:`a\cdot b' + a'\cdot b` vanishes,
    and a maximal commuting set is a Lagrangian subspace. Identifying

    actually uses. The two agree only up to :math:`n = 2`. Writing the :math:`Z`
    component in the trace-dual basis, so its coordinates are
    :math:`\mathrm{Tr}(e_l y)`, turns the trace form into the dot product and makes the
    construction correct for every width.

    Each entry is a list of ``width`` generators ``(a, b)``, and ``L_infinity`` comes
    last so the all-Z set is the one the decomposition treats separately.
