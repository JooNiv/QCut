"""Group cut locations that share a single quasiprobability decomposition.

Cutting each location separately costs the product of their sampling overheads. Some
groups of cuts have a joint decomposition that costs strictly less, so a QPD term has to
be able to span several cut locations at once.

A :class:`Bundle` names the locations that share one decomposition. Its terms carry an
operation per *side* acting on as many qubits as the bundle holds, where side 0 is the
control-side placeholder of every cut and side 1 the target-side one. A bundle of one
is exactly the single-cut case, with one-qubit operations, and takes the original code
path.

The only joint decomposition here is :mod:`QCut.qpd_joint`, for parallel two-qubit
rotation gates.
