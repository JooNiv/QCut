"""Joint quasiprobability decomposition for several parallel two-qubit rotation gates.

Cutting gates one at a time costs the product of their sampling overheads. For gates
that are locally equivalent to a rotation about a single Cartan axis this is not
optimal. Cutting ``n`` of them together costs

.. math::

    \\gamma = 2 \\prod_s (1 + |\\sin\\theta_s|) - 1

against :math:`\\prod_s (1 + 2|\\sin\\theta_s|)` for separate cuts, so two CNOT gates
cost 7 rather than 9 and three cost 15 rather than 27. The number of terms falls too,
from :math:`6^n` to :math:`O(4^n)`.

The construction is Eq. (C16) of C. Ufrecht et al., "Optimal joint cutting of two-qubit
rotation gates", Phys. Rev. A 109, 052440 (2024),
`arXiv:2312.09679 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09679>`_. It needs no ancilla qubits and
no classical communication between the partitions. See
``docs/theory/Joint_rotation_derivation.md``.

The gates have to be parallel, meaning schedulable in one time slice, because the
operations act jointly on subsets of one partition's qubits rather than on single
qubits.
