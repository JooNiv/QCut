"""Generate quasiprobability decompositions for arbitrary two-qubit gates.

The hand-derived tables in :mod:`QCut.qpd` cover ``cz``, ``swap`` and ``iswap``. This
module generalises the derivation in ``docs/theory/SWAP_derivation.md`` so a QPD can be
produced for any two-qubit gate.

The construction is Eq. (19) of K. Mitarai and K. Fujii, "Overhead for simulating a
non-local channel with local channels by quasiprobability sampling", Quantum 5, 388
(2021), `arXiv:2006.11174 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11174>`_. Its third line is the
term ``SWAP_derivation.md`` omits, which vanishes for SWAP but is needed in general.

Two conventions differ from that page and both are pinned by
``tests/test_qpd_generate.py``. ``TwoQubitWeylDecomposition`` puts a plus sign in the
KAK exponent where the page writes a minus, which conjugates :math:`u` and flips the
sign of the third line. And in :mod:`QCut.qpd_gates` the ``axyp``/``axym`` and
``ayzp``/``ayzm`` pairs are labelled the opposite way round from the paper, so the
mapping below crosses them over. See ``docs/theory/General_2q_derivation.md``.
