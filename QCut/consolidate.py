"""Merge runs of gates on the same qubit pair so the pair costs one cut.

If a circuit applies several two-qubit gates to the same pair with nothing else
touching those qubits in between, the whole run is itself one two-qubit unitary.
Cutting that unitary once is cheaper than cutting each gate, because the sampling
overhead of separate cuts multiplies. Two ``rzz(0.4)`` gates cost ``gamma = 3.16`` over
36 experiment groups apart, and ``gamma = 2.43`` over 6 as the single ``rzz(0.8)`` they
compose to.

QCut already requires that if one two-qubit gate on a pair is cut then every gate on
that pair is cut, otherwise the subcircuits cannot be separated. So merging is less an
optimisation of the user's choice than the cheapest way to honour one they already
made.

A cut marker is opaque, so it is unwrapped to the gate it carries before its run is
merged, and the result is marked again. Wire cut markers end a run rather than being
absorbed into it, since the cut has to stay where it was placed.

A run does not have to be contiguous. An instruction on disjoint qubits commutes with
the whole run and is simply skipped, and one that overlaps the pair is slid past
whenever it commutes with the members that would move across it. That second case is
the common one in an Ising or QAOA layer, where neighbouring ``rzz`` and ``cz`` gates
all commute, and without it a pair's gates are rarely adjacent enough to merge at all.
